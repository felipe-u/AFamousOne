                John Wick, born Jardani Jovonovich, is a former assassin trained by the Ruska Roma who became infamous
                as the feared “Baba Yaga” for his unmatched skill and ruthlessness. After years of killing, he left the
                underworld by completing an impossible task, retiring to live peacefully with his wife Helen. Following
                her death, and the killing of the puppy she left him as a final gift, John was drawn back into the
                violent world he had abandoned. His quest for vengeance set off a chain of events that made him an enemy
                of the global criminal order known as the High Table, cementing his legacy as both a legend and a hunted
                man.
